### Udacity BikeShare Project


### Description
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the **United States**â€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
**chicago.csv** - Stored in the data folder, the chicago.csv file is the dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Chicago provided by Udacity.

**new_york_city.csv** - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of New York provided by Udacity.

**washington.csv** - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Washington provided by Udacity. Note: This does not include the 'Gender' or 'Birth Year' data.
